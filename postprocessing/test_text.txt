A vast majority of people is convinced that the percentage of crimes among young people went up dramatically and in modern day the rate reached its peak. This problem should be taken under discussion othertwise the number of crimes would be increasing.
To begin with, well growing up plays the significant role in behaviour of adolescents. Parents should take care of ther children and explain how vital is not to commit a crime and think about their future. As a matter of fact, a great amount of teenagers thinks that it is the most simple way to make their living and starts grabbing things from the shops. In other words, it is important to get trough the gap year by talking to you children since young age. On the other hand, it is dificcult to reach a compromise with teenagers because at this age they prefer to trust their friends and the only way to solve the problem is to control the friends of your children.

Moreover, education is a key factor to avoid crimes made by young people. To give an example, the goverment should create the course about discipline and encourage people to gain knowledge about laws and how do they work to decline the percentage of crimes. By and large, it is rather long way to get rid of crimes but it, apperently, would work. For instance, there are lessons about discrimination and sexual harassment in schools, it is possible to add talks about crimes or gives examples of people who behaved that way and ended badly.

To make a conclusion, the rising amount of crimes commited by young people is the problem which is needed to be solved so by joining efforts we can decrease the rate of crimes.
